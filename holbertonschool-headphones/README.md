## Clone

`git clone https://github.com/Edin93/holberton-headphones.git`

## Requirements

- We must work only with pure HTML and CSS.
- We are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap, MUI...).
- We are not to use Javascript.
- The web page has to be responsive.

## Best practices to follow

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

## Design informations

- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

## Screenshots
